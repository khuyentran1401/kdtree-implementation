# Implementation of KdTree and Range Search

KdTree is a data structure that could be used to find data in a particular range efficiently. 

The implementation of KdTree could be found [here](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/kdtree-implementation/blob/master/kdtree.py)

The article for this repo could be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-search-data-with-kdtree-aad5c82ebd99?source=friends_link&sk=e99d0288397dcc2073172132ba82447c)

# An example of KdTree

To visualize the data structure of KdTree on a real dataset, I use a dataset for locations of ECOBICI’s stations (Mexico’s City bike public sharing system). To observe the structure, clone this repo then run
```
python ecobi.py
```
To find data in a particular range, run
```
python findrange.py
```
Enter the range in the prompt to retrieve the data.
